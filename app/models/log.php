     * This behavior is created to be a plug-and-play database changes log
     * that will work out of the box as using the created and modified fields
     * does in cake core. It is NOT version control, undo or meant to be used as
     * part of the public application. It's intent is to easily let you (the
     * developer) log users activities that relates to database modifications
     * (ie, add, edit and delete). If you just want to see what your users are
     * doing or need to be able to say "That is not a bug, I can see from my log
     * that you deleted the post yesterday." and don't want to spend more time
     * that it takes to do "var $actsAs = array('Logable');" then this behavior
     * is for you.
